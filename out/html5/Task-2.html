                <div class="p">Players reach the conclusion of Desert Bus in one of two ways:<ul class="ul" id="Untitled__ul_gq1_nwh_ghb">
                        <li class="li">At the completion of one leg of the trip between Tucson, AZ and Las
                            Vegas, NV, for which players receive one point, they are prompted to
                            decide whether or not they would like to attempt the trip back for an
                            additional point. Theoretically, these trips back and forth, and the
                            awarded points for completing them, can continue until the end of time.
                            If a player elects not to continue, or does not elect to continue within
                            a several second window, the game is over and a screen will appear
                            displaying the players' total points earned. </li>
                        <li class="li">If the bus veers off the road at any point during play, it will remain
                            stuck there until a tow truck arrives to bring it back to the
                            destination from which it left. When the tow truck arrives back at this
                            destination, the game is over and a screen will appear displaying the
                            players' total points earned (a point will <strong class="ph b">not</strong> be awarded for the
                            uncompleted trip).</li>
